      <p>This blog is the official source for the updates from the React team. Anything important,including release
        notes or deprecation notices, will be posted here first. You can also follow the <span>@reactjs</span> account
        on Twitter, but you won't miss anything essential if you only read this blog.</p>

      <h2>React Labs: What We've Been Working On - February 2024</h2>

        made significant progress on React Compiler, new features, and React 19, and we'd like to share what we learned.

      <h2>React Canaries: Incremental Feature Rollout Outside Meta</h2>
      <p class="date">May 3, 2023</p>
      <p>Traditionally, new React features used to only be available at Meta first, and land in the open source releases
        later. We'd like to offer the React community an option to adopt individual new features as soon as their design
        is close to finalâ€”similar to how Meta uses React internally. We are introducing a new officially supported
        Canary release channel. It lets curated setups like frameworks decouple adoption of individual React features
        from the React release schedule.</p>
